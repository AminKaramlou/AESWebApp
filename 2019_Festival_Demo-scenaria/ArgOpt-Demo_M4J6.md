### Scenario

4 nurses have been initially allocated 6 patient procedures: 
nurse 1 was supposed to do procedures A and B, each taking 30 minutes; 
nurse 2 was assigned procedure C taking 10 minutes; 
nurse 3 was given procedures D and E taking 10 and 20 minutes, respectively; 
nurse 4 was left with procedure F taking 40 minutes.    
This allocation comprises the initial **schedule**.

#### Two alternatives

* Alternative 1

   It turns out that nurse 1 lacks qualification to do procedure A, 
   and that the patient in need of procedure B asked specifically for nurse 2 instead. 

* Alternative 2

   It turns out that nurse 1 has fallen ill and thus cannot do any procedures at all, 
   and that the patient in need of procedure B asked specifically for nurse 2 instead. 

Use the explanations provided to modify the initial schedule so that 
the unexpected circumstances (regarding nurse 1) 
and patient preferences (nurse 2 required for procedure B) 
are satisfied, 
and the procedures are done efficiently 
(any longest working nurse should finish as soon as possible).
