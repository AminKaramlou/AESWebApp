### Scenario

3 nurses have been initially allocated 4 patient procedures: 
nurse 1 was supposed to do procedures A and B, taking 10 and 30 minutes respectively; 
nurse 2 was assigned procedure C taking 30 minutes; 
nurse 3 was given procedure D taking 20 minutes.  
This allocation comprises the initial **schedule**.

It turns out that nurse 1 lacks qualification to do procedure A, 
and that the patient in need of procedure D asked specifically for nurse 2 instead. 

Use the explanations provided to modify the initial schedule so that 
the unexpected circumstances (nurse 1 unqualified for procedure A) 
and patient preferences (nurse 2 required for procedure D) 
are satisfied, 
and the procedures are done efficiently 
(any longest working nurse should finish as soon as possible).
