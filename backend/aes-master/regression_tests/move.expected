Schedule is feasible
 -  All jobs are allocated to exactly one machine
Schedule does satisfies user fixed decisions
 -  All jobs satisfy all fixed decisions
Schedule is not efficient because:
 -  Job A can be allocated from machine 1 to 2 to reduce by 1.0
 -  Job B can be allocated from machine 1 to 2 to reduce by 1.0
